# Kaleidoscope

Kaleidoscope allows you to model and analyse option spread prices and greeks from historical options data. Use the built-in methods to price various options spreads or construct your own composite option spreads and plot the changes in price and greeks as time passes.

The following strategies are currently supported:
* Single Calls/Puts
* Vertical Spreads
* Iron Condors (Iron Butterflies)
* Covered Calls

Planned Support:
* Combos (Synthetics/Collars)
* Diagonal Spreads
* Calendar Spreads
* Custom Spreads
